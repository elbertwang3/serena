                    <p className="prose dark">Serena's story starts before she and older sister Venus were even born.
                   Their father, the inimitable Richard Williams, had already had conceived a vision for his future
                   daughters. It was in 1980--after seeing
                    Romanian tennis player Virginia Ruzici collecting a $40,000 check for winning a small tournament
                    in Salt Lake City on TV--that he decided that his not-yet-existent daughters would be tennis stars.
                 </p>
                 <p className="prose dark">He started to take tennis lessons from a man who went by Old Whiskey, lessons
                   he paid for with booze. He then drafted a 78-page plan, a manifesto of sorts, on how he was going to make
                   his daughters champions. In 1990, when Venus was just 10 years old, he predicted that she was going to be No. 1
                   in the world, and that Serena, then 9, would be even better than Venus. When film producer Arnon Milchan met
                   Richard late in 1997, he said, "You know when you meet somebody, and you think he's either insane or he's a genius?"
                   Looking back, history has judged him the latter, and his wild proclamations seem almost prophetic today. </p>

                    <p className="prose dark">Shortly after, the family, including their three older sisters, relocated to Compton, California.
                    Their journey began on the rough public tennis courts of East Compton Park, where they once had to stop practice
                    to duck for cover when they heard gunshots. With weeds poking through the ground and broken glass and beer bottles strewn about,
                    the courts were a far cry from the manicured lawns of Centre Court at Wimbledon.
                  </p>
                    <p className="prose dark">
                    Yet Compton "would make them tough, give them a fighter's mentality," Richard wrote
                    in his autobiography. "And how much easier would it be to play in front of thousands of
                    white people if they had already learned to play in front of scores of armed gang members?"

                      to train at Rick Macci's tennis academy. Macci and Richard sometimes clashed, and in 1995,
                      he pulled his daughters out of the academy, coaching them himself. He also took them out
                      of the junior circuit, citing the intensity of the other parents and how time consuming it was.

                    {/*<p className="prose dark">
                      More important than tennis, Richard wanted his daughters to receive and education and develop
                      interests off the court as well. "When I look at young players on the tennis tour, it seems
                      the better they are, the less education they have," he said. With the time they would have used
                      preparing for junior tournaments, they attended private school and participated in other activities.
                      Through careful planning by Richard and mom Oracene, Serena and Venus have balanced their time on and off
                      the court, and a result, they've avoided burnout and lasted on the tour well into their 30s,

                      day at the tennis courts." Few could have predicted that Serena would grow into the champion that she has become,

              <h2> Serena's Serve </h2>
              <p className="prose"> While ATP players routinely dominate on serve,
                WTA players don't win their service games nearly as often due to their relatively weaker serves. Some of this discrepancy
                has been attributed to physiological differences, but Dr. Ben Kibler, an orthopedic surgeon, found that it's
                often a technical--not physiological--deficit.
              </p>
              <p className="prose">"The largest disparity found by Kibler between male and female professionals was in pushing off with their back legs,
                which 75 percent of the men in the study did effectively compared with only 28 percent of the women," a NY Times story found.
              </p>
              <p className="prose">
              In the following graphic, as you scroll, you can see how Serena torques and drills her lower body
              into the ground before pushing off for her serve, generating power not just from racquet head speed
              but more importantly, her legs, like a loaded spring.

              <p className="prose">Yet serve speed doesn't tell the whole story. Plenty of players serve fast,
                but they aren't nearly as successful as Serena is on serve. One difference is that Serena hits
                her spots.</p>

                       out wide or up the T. With speed combined with placement, many of her first serves are unreturnable. On any given serve,
                     her likelihood of hitting an ace is 13%, a rate three times higher than the average WTA player.  </p>

              <p className="prose">Serena's serve allows her to get ahead during the rally, end points quickly,
                and wipe away break points easily when she's down. When it's on, no one can break her serve.
                 It has been the key to her success.</p>
              <h2> Dominating on Serve and Return </h2>
              <p className="prose"> Serena wins the highest percentage of serve points by a large margin, and she's
                not far behind leader Justine Henin on return. Punishing opponents with weak serves, she hits return
                winners on serves that sit up for her to pummel back. This is a cornerstone of her power game,
                a playstyle that she and would Venus popularize, and what tennis commentator Mary Carillo has affectionately
                dubbed "Big Babe Tennis."

                {/*<p className="prose">
              When the sisters debuted on the tour, the no. 1 player at the time was Martina Hingis.
                With a game based on touch and guile, for a period, Hingis was invincible. But it was short-lived.
               She was was simply overpowered by the Williams sisters and the players they would later influence,
               unable to handle the pace of her bigger and taller opponents.

              <p className="prose">While the men's tour has been dominated by the Big 4 for the last decade, the
                women's tour has not had quite an equivalent cohort of players. Although several players have taken
                the No. 1 spot (some even without a grand slam), they've come and gone. For most of her career,
                Serena has been a league of her own. Still, throughout the years, she has had her share of rivals,
                with Venus being her fiercest one for all these years.  </p>

                and other players using the search box. Some other notable rivalries include Victoria Azarenka,
                Jennifer Capriati, Justin Henin, and Elena Dementieva. </p>

              <h2> Serena Under Pressure </h2>
              <p className="prose"> When Serena is at her best, no player can beat her. In that vein, tennis commentators have often
                said that Serena is her own worst enemy. To win, she simply must overcome herself. Yet she thrives under these moments.
                 How Serena digs deep in the third set, during a tiebreak, and when she's down is what makes her a champion.

              <h2> Serena's Longevity </h2>
              <p className="prose">
                Much of Serena's greatness can be attributed to her longevity. Other than Venus, she's simply been around longer
                than anyone else on tour. While many of her rivals retired early and made short-lived comebacks (read: Hingis, Clijsters, Henin),
                Serena has stuck around, outlasting her contemporary rivals and surpassing past tennis legends in the process.
              </p>
              <p className="prose">
                On the men's tour, Roger Federer seemed like he was on the decline when he went slamless for four years,
                but over the past year and half he's been in the middle of a late-career renaissance, winning the Australian Open
                and Wimbledon last year. Like Serena, he's avoided injury and burnout by choosing tournaments carefully
                and prioritizing the slams, a strategy that has allowed them to be successful well into their 30s.
              </p>
              <p className="prose">
                Some critics have said that Serena isn't the greatest of all time because she hasn't had a worthy rival
                like Nadal is to Federer, Evert was to Navratilova, or Seles was to Graf. But she's simply been better
                than everyone else, and no one has stood up to take her place for all these years.

                    grand slams. I'm well aware of the record books, unfortunately. It's not a secret that I have my sights on 25."

                      and if she wins another slam, she will join Evonne Goolagang and Kim Clijsters as mothers who have won
                    a grand slam title.</p>

              <p className="prose"> When we think about measuring the greatest of all time, we tend to think in terms of numbers:
                the best win-loss record (Graf), the most weeks at no. 1 (Graf), the most titles (Navratilova). Serena doesn't win
                in any of these categories. Yet her intangible qualities and accomplishments--ones not so easily
                measured or compared--make her one of the greatest athletes of all time. </p>
              <p className="prose"> When I think about Serena, I think of her childhood on the shabby public courts of
                Compton, how her father fed tennis balls to her from a rickety shopping cart. I think about how she and
                Venus transformed the women's game, ushering in the current era of power tennis. I think about her performance
                at the 2007 Australian Open, when she, ranked 81st and unseeded, out of shape, and having dealt with injuries
                and the death of her sister Yetunde, crushed Sharapova in the final to win the title. I think about how she's
                recovered from life-threatening pulmonary embolisms--one in 2010 and another after her pregnancy--and returned to the game
                as strong as ever.
              </p>
                <p className="prose">
                I think about all the times she's been down a set and a break, but found it in herself to come back. I think about
                the way she roars "Come on!" with fists pumped, willing herself to win. I think about how, unlike Federer who
                makes it look easy, she makes tennis look effortful, the way she runs down every ball, fights for every point,
                and claws her way back into a match.
              </p>
              <p className="prose">
                Coming back from her pregnancy may be the toughest hurdle in her career yet.
                But if anyone is up to the challenge, it's Serena.
