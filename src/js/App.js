                  <p className="prose dark">Serena's story starts before she and older sister Venus were even born.
                 Their father, the inimitable Richard Williams, had already had conceived a vision for his future
                 daughters. It was in 1980--after flipping through channels on television when he came across
                  Romanian tennis player Virginia Ruzici, who had won a tournament in Salt Lake City and collected a
                  check for $40,000--that he decided that his not-yet-existent daughters would be tennis stars.
               </p>
               <p className="prose dark">He started to take tennis lessons from a man who went by Old Whiskey, lessons
                 he paid for with booze. He then drafted a 78-page plan, a manifesto of sorts, about how he was going to make
                 his daughters champions. In 1990, when Venus was just 10 years old, he predicted that she was going to be No. 1
                 in the world, and that Serena, then 9, would be even better than Venus. When film producer Arnon Milchan met
                 Richard late in 1997, he said, "You know when you meet somebody, and you think he's either insane or he's a genius?"
                 Looking back, history has judged him the latter, and his wild proclamations seem almost prophetic today. </p>

                  <p className="prose dark">Shortly after, the family, including their three older sisters, relocated to Compton, California.
                  Their journey began on the rough public tennis courts of East Compton Park, where they once had to stop practice
                  to duck for cover when they heard gunshots. With weeds poking through the ground and broken glass and beer bottles strewn around, the courts were a
                  far cry from the manicured lawns of Wimbledon's Centre Court.
                </p>
                  <p className="prose dark">
                  Yet Compton "would make them tough, give them a fighter's mentality," Richard wrote
                  in his autobiography. "And how much easier would it be to play in front of thousands of
                  white people if they had already learned to play in front of scores of armed gang members?"

                  <p className="prose dark">When Serena turned 9, the family moved to West Palm Beach, FL
                    to train at Rick Macci's tennis academy. Macci and Richard sometimes clashed, and in 1995,
                    he pulled his daughters out of the academy, coaching them himself. He also took them out
                    of the junior circuit, citing the intensity of the other parents and how time consuming it was.

                  <p className="prose dark">
                    More important than tennis, Richard wanted Serena and Venus to receive and education and develop
                    interests off the court as well. "When I look at young players on the tennis tour, it seems
                    the better they are, the less education they have," he said. With the time they would have used
                    preparing for junior tournaments, he sent them to private school and enrolled them in other activities.
                    Through careful planning by Richard and mom Oracene, Serena and Venus balanced their time on and off
                    the court, and a result, they've avoided burnout and lasted on the tour well into their 30s,
                    long after most players retire. </p>

                  <p className="prose dark">
                    Asked to comment on the match years later, Miller said, smiling, "In my mind I had every shot of winning the match [because I had]
                    a little more experience than she had at the time, so I played a good match, and won. I thought it was just another
                    day at the tennis courts." While Miller left tennis a couple years later and sought out a normal life,
                    Serena went on to accomplish something quite extraordinary.

            So why is Serena the greatest of all time? Let us count the ways.
            </p>
            <h2> Serena's Serve </h2>
            <p className="prose"> While ATP players routinely dominate their serve,
              WTA players don't hold serve nearly as often due to their relatively weaker serves. Some of this discrepancy
              has been attributed to physiological differences, but Dr. Ben Kibler, an orthopedic surgeon, found that it's
              often a technical--not physiological--deficit.
            </p>
            <p className="prose">"The largest disparity found by Kibler between male and
              female professionals was in pushing off with their back legs, which 75 percent of the men in the study
              did effectively compared with only 28 percent of the women," a NY Times story found.

              In the following graphic, you can see how Serena does a deep knee bend and before pushing off,
              generating power not just from racquet speed but more importantly, her legs.

            <p className="prose">Serena's serve allows her to get ahead during the rally, end points quickly,
              and wipe away break points easily when she's down. When it's on, no one can break her serve.
               It has been the key to her success.</p>
            <h2> Dominating on Serve and Return </h2>
            <p className="prose"> Serena wins the highest percentage of serve points by a largin margin, and she's
              not far behind leader Justine Henin on return. Punishing opponents with weak serves, she can hit return
              winners on serves that sit up for her to pummel back. This is a cornerstone of her power game,
              a playstyle that she and Venus popularized, and what tennis commentator Mary Carillo affectionately
              calls "Big Babe Tennis."

            <h2> Serena's Rivals </h2>
            <p className="prose">While the men's tour has been dominated by the Big 4 for the last decade, the
              women's tour has not had quite an equivalent cohort of players. Although several players have taken
              the No. 1 spot (some even without a grand slam), they've come and gone. For most of her career,
              Serena has been a league of her own. Still, throughout the years, she has had her share of rivals,
              with Venus being her fiercest one for all these years.  </p>

            <h2> Search for a Head-to-Head </h2>

            <p className="prose"> After all these years, no one Serena has played more than two matches against has had a winning
              record against her, except for one player--Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. Search for her,
              and other players using the search box. Some other notable rivalries include Victoria Azarenka,
              Jennifer Capriati, Justin Henin, and Elena Dementieva. </p>

            <h2> Under Pressure </h2>
            <p className="prose"> When Serena is at her best, no player can beat her. In that vein, tennis commentators have often
              said that Serena is her own worst enemy. To win, she simply must overcome herself. Yet she thrives under these moments.
               How Serena digs deep in the third set, during a tiebreak, and when she's down is what makes her a champion.
